//*Arrays
//*JavaScript arrays is an object that represents collection of similar type of elements.

//! Iterable - object where you can use the for-of loop
//! Array-like object - Any object with length property and use indexes to access items
//!Arrays as Objects:  Arrays in JavaScript are a specific type of object that has numeric
//keys (indices) and a length property. The indices are automatically maintained, and the
//length property is automatically updated when you add or remove elements from the array.
//! typeof Operator: The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for both arrays and
// regular objects.

//Index Number   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
//Const person = a   b   c   d   e   f   g

const persons = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];
console.log(typeof persons);
//The type  of array is objec.
console.log(persons.length);
//Here we willl get the output as a 5 because the length of array is 5
console.log(persons.length - 1);
//But if we want the indexes we have to do this and that is "perons.length-1".
console.log(persons.at(-1));
//This .at() method is useful to index the last elements off arrays eaily.
console.log(persons[-1]);
//If we use traditional method it will give as undefined.
console.log(persons.at(-4));

//* creating an array

//? using Array constructor
let fruites = new Array("apples", "oranges", "mango");
console.log(fruites);

//? using array literals
let fruites1 = ["apples", "oranges", "mango"];
console.log(fruites1);

//? we can also create an empty array
let arr = [];

//*Accessiong Elements

//?ðŸ‘‰ Accessing Elements:  Array elements are accessed using zero-based indices.
let fruites2 = ["apples", "oranges", "mango", 1];
console.log(fruites2[3]);
// console.log(fruites2["apples"]);//This will never happen and gives you undefined.
console.log(typeof fruites2[3]); //We can check the type of any element of array using this

//*Modifying elements

//?ðŸ‘‰  Modifying Elements: You can modify array elements by assigning new values to specific indices.

// let bikes = ["Himalyan", "classic-350", "GT-650"];
// bikes[2] = "GT-Continental";
// console.log(bikes);

//* Array Traversal / iterating over arrays

let bikes = [
  "Himalyan",
  "classic-350",
  "GT-650",
  "GT-Continetal",
  "Humter-350",
];

//? for of loop, also know as iterable
//* for...of Loop: The for...of loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object,
//* such as arrays, strings, or other iterable objects.
//* We can say that, This is simplified version of for loop for arrays.

for (let item of bikes) {
  console.log(item);
}

//Here is the only for loop but "For of loop" is more reliable for arrays.
// for(let item = 0; item < bikes.length; item++){
//     console.log(bikes[item]);
// }

//? 2: for in loop
//* for...in Loop: The for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties (including indices)
//* of an object.
//* Here in for in loop "in" is index.
//* And here we are using loop for the index numbers of the array.

for (let item in bikes) {
  console.log(item);
}

// ? 3: forEach Method
//* The arr.forEach() method calls the provided function once for each element of the array.
//* The provided function may perform any kind of operation on the elements of the given array.

//This is using traditional function method
// bikes.forEach(function
//     callback(curElem, index, arr){
//         console.log(`${curElem} ${index}`);
//     }
// )

//This is usin the fat arrow function
//Here we are getting output as a currentElement and its index like
//Himalyan 0
//classic-350 1
//GT-650 2

// bikes.map((curElem, index, arr) => {
//     console.log(`${curElem} ${index}`);
//     console.log(arr);
// })

const myForEachBikes = bikes.forEach((curElem, index, arr) => {
  return `${curElem} ${index}`;
  // console.log(arr);
});

console.log(myForEachBikes);
//! Here we learned something that when we store this forEach into some variable and when we call
//! This we will get output as a undefined. SO this is the disadvantage of the forEach loop
//! But the advanage is that when we are creating some websites we have to get some data from the
//! user but we dont want to do anything with that data and we just want to print that data we can
//! use forEach loop.

// ? 4: map function
//* map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.
//* map() does not change the original array.

bikes.map((curElem, index, arr) => {
  console.log(`${curElem} ${index}`);
  // console.log(arr);
});

const arrForEach = bikes.map((curElem, index, arr) => {
  return `My favourite bike is ${curElem}`;
});

console.log(arrForEach);
console.log(bikes);
//Now we know that if we want to create a new array using the original we can use map function
//Here we have called both the arrays new one and old one. so there will be no change in old
//one but we have created the new array using the old one.
//! Not like in the forEach method, here when we call the variable "map" function will create
//! an new array with the values and it'll return that.

// todo Practice Questions
//! write a program to Multiply each element with 2
//! forEach -  Performs an action on each element
//! map -  Creates a new array with transformed elements

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

//*using forEach
numbers.forEach((curElem) => {
  console.log(curElem * 2);
  // Performs an action on each element
});

//*using map
const doubleNumbers = numbers.map((curElem) => {
  return `${curElem * 2}`;
  // Creates a new array with transformed elements
});
console.log(doubleNumbers);

//* Key Differences
//! Return Value:
//? forEach: It doesn't return a value. The forEach method is used for iterating over the
//? elements of an array and performing a side effect, such as modifying the array or
//? performing a task for each element.

//? map: It returns a new array containing the results of applying a function to each
//? element in the original array. The original array remains unchanged.

//! Chaining:
//? forEach: It doesn't return a value, so it cannot be directly chained with other array
//? methods. (Basically when you want to perform another task using the result that you have
//? got from first, it's not possible. Because forEach method doesn't returns any value.)

//? map: Since it returns a new array, you can chain other array methods after using map.
//? (But here we can perform another task to the result array. because this methid will return
//? the values and we can perform anything to that values)

//* Use Case:
//? forEach: Used when you want to iterate over the array elements and perform an action on
//? each element, but you don't need a new array.

//? map: Used when you want to create a new array based on the transformation of each element
//? in the original array.

//syntax
// splice(startIndex, deletecount, item1, item2, item3, ...., itemN)
console.log(bikes.splice()); //Here it gives empty array

//?1: indexOf Method: The indexOf method returns the index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
//? Syntax: numbers.indexOf(searchElement, fromIndex)
console.log(`The indes of 8 is ${numbers1.indexOf(8, 2)}`); //here the index of 8 is originally 9 but we have written another parameter and that is fromIndex, so now the index will be count from the number 2, so it will become 8.
console.log(numbers1.includes(9));

//? 2: lastIndexOf Method: The lastIndexOf() method of Array instances returns the last index at which a given element(The elements which are same only) can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present. The array is searched backwards, starting at fromIndex.
console.log(numbers1.lastIndexOf(6)); //Here output will be index number 6 because it returs the indes of last value present in the array, here there are two 6 so this method will take the last 6 and will return its index.
console.log(numbers1.lastIndexOf(6, 4)); //Here the output will be 4 because the starting index that we have given is 4 and at the index 4 we have value 6, so the output will be 4.

//? 3: The includes method checks whether an array includes a certain element, returning true or false.

//? Map(), Filter(), Reduce(),
// map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.
// map() does not execute the function for empty elements.
// map() does not change the original array.

//? Reduce method
// The reduce method in JavaScript is used to accumulate or reduce an array to a single value. It iterates over the elements of an array and applies a callback function to each element, updating an accumulator value with the result. The reduce method takes a callback function as its first argument and an optional initial value for the accumulator as the second argument.

// syntax
// array.reduce(function callback(accumulator, currentValue, index, array) {
// Your logic here
// Return the updated accumulator value
// }, initialValue);

// callback: A function that is called once for each element in the array.
// accumulator: The accumulated result of the previous iterations.Basically the result of previous iteration as we saw inn the below example
// currentValue: The current element being processed in the array.
// index (optional): The index of the current element being processed.
// array (optional): The array reduce was called upon.
// initialValue (optional): An initial value for the accumulator. If not provided, the first element of the array is used as the initial accumulator value.

//! Calculate the total price using the reduce method.
const productPrice = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500];

const totalPrice = productPrice.reduce((accum, curElem) => {
  return accum + curElem;
}, 0); //Basically the value of accumulator in the starting is 0, and with every iteration it goes on like first its 0, then 0 + 100 than 100 + 200 and then finally we will get the total value.
